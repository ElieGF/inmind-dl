# Overview
This repository contains the work completed during my internship at Inmind.ai, focusing on machine learning and computer vision. It includes solutions to in-class exercises and the code for the final project.


# Structure
Final Project: Contains the complete implementation of the final project, including models for semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) and object detection (YOLOv7). The project also includes an inference API, Dockerized for deployment, and performance tracking using TensorBoard.

Session 1-6: Solutions to the exercises provided during the academy sessions, covering various topics such as classical machine learning, NLP, GIT fundamentals, and more.
